# Personal Container Registry
Personal docker registry, for easily storing local containers used in personal project development.

If you plan on running your registry using SSL, `cd` into the `scripts/` directory and run the `generate-certs.sh` script to create some certs that will be used by the registry container.

To start up the registry, `cd` into the `scripts/` directory and run `startup.sh`.
